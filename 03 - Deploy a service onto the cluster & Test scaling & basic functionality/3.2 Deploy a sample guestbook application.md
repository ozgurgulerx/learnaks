## Deploying guestbook app without configmap

In this section we will deploy the classic guestbook sample k8s application. 
We will be mostly following the steps from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/ 

Guestbook app is a multi-tier web application.
The different tiers in the app will have multiple instances.
Frontend is a stateless PHP app whereas the backend is the stateful tier keeping guestbook entries on redis.
(All required files are under the folder "3.2 guestbook app files".)
This is a good example to spot how a Deployment is related to a ReplicaSet and the Replicaset to a Pod.

`kubectl apply -f redis-master-deployment.yaml`

Let's first go over the k8s manifest file...

Next check the deployment details...

We will now delete the deployment and recreate it with a configmap.

`kubectl apply -f redis-master-deployment.yaml`

## Deploying guestbook app with configmap

With the modified manifest file, you are adding the ConfigMap as a volume and mounting the volume. You are able to load dynamic configuration.
