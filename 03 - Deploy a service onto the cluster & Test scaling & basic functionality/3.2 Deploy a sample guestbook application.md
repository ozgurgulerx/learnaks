In this section we will deploy the classic guestbook sample k8s application. 
We will be mostly following the steps from https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/ 

Guestbook app is a multi-tier web application.
The different tiers in the app will have multiple instances.
Frontend is a stateless PHP app whereas the backend is the stateful tier keeping guestbook entries on redis.
(All required files are under the folder "3.2 guestbook app files".)

`kubectl apply -f redis-master-deployment.yaml`
