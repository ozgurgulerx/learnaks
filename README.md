# LEARN-AKS 
This project is to help newcomers learn AKS with "deliberate practice".


Microservices architecture is common when developing developing distributed systems.
A microservices application consists of a group of services that work together to form an application, while the individual services themselves can be built, tested, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. Those services work together over a network , commonly using HTTP REST APIs or gRPC.
Such an architecture is commonly deployed on containers and with Kubernetes.
AKS is Azure's managed service for Kubernetes.
